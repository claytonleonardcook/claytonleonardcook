### **[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) @ [Project Kuiper](https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services/project-kuiper)** | Hybrid

July&nbsp;2025 - Present

Within the Kuiper Project, I spearheaded the development of a web portal for third-party service integration, focusing on modular architecture and logic simplification. I integrated LLM-based tools into our CI/CD pipeline to automate the generation of unit tests and accessibility checks, significantly increasing our overall test coverage. I have collaborated with cross-functional teams, including product, design, and back-end, to align the application with Amazon's specifications. Working within peer programming groups, I shared best practices for LLM-prompt engineering to accelerate code reviews and architectural prototyping. To streamline development for my team, I authored comprehensive documentation covering onboarding essentials and coding standards. I am also an advocate for improving the application's test coverage and ensuring a more accessible user experience.

### **[Cellar&nbsp;Door](https://www.cellar-door.io/) @ [Garanimals & Easy-Peasy](https://www.easypeasy.com)** | Remote

January&nbsp;2024 - July&nbsp;2025

Architected and maintained a Next.js platform that empowered non-technical teams to author rich content and drive direct-to-consumer sales which has serviced more than 50,000 users. I helped lay the project's foundational architecture, worked in close collaboration with our lead designer via Figma, interfaced with Drupal CMS for content management and integrated Shopify's Storefront API for e-commerce functionality. On a daily basis, I enhanced performance by optimizing network requests, refactored repeated logic into custom React hooks and delivered on new features.

### **[Cellar&nbsp;Door](https://www.cellar-door.io/) @ [EverBank](https://www.everbank.com)** | Remote

December&nbsp;2022 - February&nbsp;2024

Developed a Next.js front-end driven by Contentstack CMS to enable content authors and maintained strict designs. I developed a library of reusable React components that dynamically rendered CMS-sourced data in alignment with design mockups, and engineered promise-based query helpers which logged errors for insight without interrupting CI builds. Collaborating closely with Everbank's internal security and infrastructure teams, I navigated complex authentication layers and adhered to stringent confidentiality protocols, ensuring a secure, maintainable codebase that empowered stakeholders to iterate on content with confidence.

### **[Cellar&nbsp;Door](https://www.cellar-door.io/) @ [Beef Jerky Experience](https://beefjerkyx.com)** | Remote

October&nbsp;2022 - January&nbsp;2023

As the sole developer, I built a cross-platform React Native application that brought their brand to life on mobile devices. Leveraging Figma designs, I crafted a suite of reusable components with responsive layouts to ensure visual consistency and smooth user experiences across iOS and Android. To streamline delivery, I implemented Expo-based CI pipelines, automating builds and deployments so we could quickly iterate on features and push updates.

### **[Cellar&nbsp;Door](https://www.cellar-door.io/) @ [Factimize](https://www.factimize.com)** | Remote

August&nbsp;2022 - October&nbsp;2023

Stepping into a mature React codebase, I tackled performance bottlenecks in Factimize's data visualizer which had significant lag under heavy data loads. I conducted a deep analysis of rendering inefficiencies and optimized critical sections. Through strategic code modularization and targeted performance profiling, I reduced frame drops and elevated the maximum visible data points, delivering a more responsive user experience without a full rewrite of the legacy system.

### **[Cellar&nbsp;Door](https://www.cellar-door.io/) @ [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com)/[Precor](https://www.precor.com)** | Remote

May&nbsp;2022 - November&nbsp;2023

Joining an established React platform, I enabled Peloton & Precor's marketing teams to author and update site content via Contentful CMS while maintaining strict adherence to established brand guidelines. I partnered closely with QA to elevate both visual fidelity and semantic accuracy, crafting reusable React components that reinforced accessibility and consistency across the application. Notably, I spearheaded the development of the International Offices page: architecting a Google Maps integration styled with brand-aligned colors, and designing interactive markers and info panels to showcase global locations.

### **Onflo @ [DirectKey](https://direct-key.vercel.app)** | Remote

January&nbsp;2021 - February&nbsp;2021

As a contract front-end engineer for DirectKey, I designed and implemented a brand-aligned marketing page to showcase their product and drive user engagement.

### **Onflo @ [Perfect Landing Rentals](https://perfectlandingrentals.com)** | Tawas,&nbsp;MI

June&nbsp;2018 - July&nbsp;2018

Gained hands-on React experience by architecting and implementing CRUD dashboard features for Perfect Landing Rentals' admin portal.

## Education

### **[Saginaw Valley State University](https://www.svsu.edu)** | Bachelor&nbsp;of&nbsp;Science&nbsp;in&nbsp;Computer&nbsp;Science

September&nbsp;2019 - May&nbsp;2025

While earning my degree, I sustained a 3.5 GPA and excelled in advanced algorithms, data structures, and systems courses. Immersed in the department's collaborative culture, I co-hosted peer study groups and knowledge-sharing workshops. Leveraging those connections, I led our NASA Lunabotics team through the full lifecycle of designing, fabricating, and programming a remote-controlled rover, culminating in competition at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. I further broadened my technical knowledge by attending the Google Developer Festival in Detroit, where I absorbed lectures on emerging technologies and frameworks. Beyond academics, I served as President of the Cardinal Robotics Club, Vice President of the Google Developer Student Club and volunteered with our Association of Computer Machinery chapter to mentor high school students in coding competitions.
